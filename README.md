**Regression Models for Predicting Final Grades**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code and data files for building and evaluating regression models to predict final grades based on student attributes. The models include linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and KNN regression.

**Files:**
1. **Code.R:** This file contains R code for generating simulated data, building regression models, evaluating model performance, and computing prediction intervals.

2. **data.csv:** This CSV file contains the simulated dataset used for training and testing the regression models. It includes features such as study hours, quiz scores, forum participation, previous grades, and final grades.

3. **README.md:** This markdown file provides an overview of the repository, including instructions for running the code and interpreting the results.

**Usage:**
1. **Running the Code:**
   - Ensure you have R installed on your system.
   - Open the Code.R file in an R environment (e.g., RStudio).
   - Execute the code to generate the dataset, build regression models, and evaluate their performance.

2. **Interpreting the Results:**
   - The code calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each regression model, comparing their goodness of fit.
   - Model accuracy using prediction intervals is computed for linear regression and decision tree regression models.
   - Results are printed to the console for easy interpretation.

**Dependencies:**
The code requires the following R packages:
- `randomForest`: For building random forest regression models.
- `rpart`: For decision tree regression.
- `caret`: For KNN regression and model evaluation.
- `ggplot2` and `lattice`: For data visualization.
